Create a complete mobile-first web-based car driving game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in ONE single HTML file (all code combined together, not separated). The design must be modern, attractive, and professional.

IMPORTANT:
- The entire interface language must be Azerbaijani.
- Code must be clean and production-ready.
- Mobile responsive design (optimized for phone screens).
- Everything must be inside one single HTML file.

GAME CONCEPT:

1) USER SYSTEM
- User must register with username and password.
- After first registration, user must not be required to register again.

2) BALANCE SYSTEM
- User must deposit balance to start the game.
- Minimum balance: 5 AZN.
- Each game round costs 0.20 AZN.

- If balance is below 5 AZN, game cannot start.

3) GAMEPLAY
- Realistic car driving style (top-down road view).
- Moving road animation.
- Traffic lights system:
  Red → Yellow → Green → Yellow → repeat
- If player moves on Red light → deduct penalty.
- Add obstacles (other cars, barriers, pedestrians).
- If player crashes or breaks traffic rules → deduct money.
- If player drives correctly → increase balance.
- Show notifications for:
  - "Qayda pozuldu! -0.50 AZN"
  - "Əla sürüş! +0.30 AZN"
- Speed control.
- Score system.

4) GAME RULES PAGE

- It must:
   - Automatically send friendly motivational messages
   - Respond automatically to user messages
   - Encourage player to continue
   - Use sweet and engaging Azerbaijani language
- If user is inactive, bot should send random encouraging messages.

6) DESIGN

- Clean dashboard style

7) EXTRA FEATURES (Add if missing)
